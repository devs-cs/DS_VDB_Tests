There are 10 images retrieval is tested on. All files are named in the format {Variance}_{Image Index}_noise_{System}. The variance denotes the value between 0 and 4.9 corresponding to the noise added to each coordinate of the fMRI data. The Image Index corresponds to the 10 images indexed from 0 to 9, and the System is either blank, representing no additional system, "DS" representing DreamScapeST1 with $\alpha = 0.7$, or "DS_2" representing DreamScapeST2 with $\alpha = 0.5$.
